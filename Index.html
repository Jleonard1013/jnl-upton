<p> A human sport, decided by a mathematical equation, calculated by a computer. That is what College Football used to determine the National Championship game for nearly two decades in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) era. Eventually the BCS had one glaring problem as Sport Management professor <a href="https://falk.syr.edu/people/deninger-dennis/"> Dennis Deninger</a> pointed out, “The BCS [because it was decided by computers] had disputes on who the true national champion was.” Ultimately, the NCAA concluded they needed to take the decision-making process out of the computers hands, and with that the College Football Playoff (CFP) was born.   </p>

<p> The CFP was introduced in 2014 as a four team playoff. Teams were chosen by a 13-member selection committee, made up of different university Athletic Directors, to ultimately decide which four teams will battle for the National Championship. Syracuse Athletic Director <a href="https://cuse.com/staff-directory/john-wildhack/572"> John Wildhack</a> agreed that the NCAA needed to find a new format different from the BCS, “[The College Football Playoff] gave defined parameters that took the computers out of the equation.”</p>


<p> With the new playoff format came a new money distribution system. In the old bowl game system the majority of bowl matchups were contracted to individual conferences. For example, the Rose Bowl was always Pac 12 vs Big 10 and the Orange Bowl was always ACC vs SEC or BIG 10. However, with the new playoff format the New Year's six bowl games, Fiesta, Peach, Sugar, Cotton, Rose, and Orange Bowl, would rotate in hosting the semifinal games each year. Therefore, the contracted conferences for the bowls would go out the window when the bowl game was slated to host a CFP game. </p>

<p> For the payout specifics, each team a conference has that is selected to a semifinal game the conference makes get $6 million, while if a team is selected to a New Year's Six Bowl, the conference makes $4 million. In addition, the regular non-New Year's Six Bowl games retained a similar payout as existed prior to the CFP.  </p>

<p> As is highlighted below the increased distribution of money resulted in growth of the finances of college football and college athletics. </p>

<p> Comparing the data from the last eight years of the BCS to the first eight years of the CFP (with adjustments for inflation) conferences have collected millions more dollars with the CFP format, the only exception being the BIG 12. “The CFP added a lot of money to the pot,” Professor Deninger illustrated how the inception of the CFP impacted the money available in college athletics. “The BCS was better from an academic standpoint, but the CFP was better for the Universities revenue.” Syracuse AD John Wildhack agreed with Deninger saying, “The CFP was just good for economics.” </p>

<p> The CFP was good for economics, especially for the BIG 10 and the SEC. As showcased in the visualization above, the two conferences dominated the money growth amongst the Power 5 because their teams regularly made it to the College Football Playoff. Since 2015 (and including the newest CFP top-4), the SEC and BIG 10 have clinched 19 of the 36 possible spots in the CFP. That is over 52% of the available slots going to those two conferences. If you tally up all of the money earned by those athletic conferences it eclipses $114 million dollars just in CFP payouts.  </p>

<p> The disparity in revenue growth is displayed below in the percent change between the media/postseason revenue of the conferences pre- and post the inauguration of the CFP. </p>

<br>

<iframe title="Conference Distribution Percent Change Pre and Post CFP" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-f2Plh" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/f2Plh/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="216" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

<br>

<p> Now you may look at the chart and point to the Pac 12 having a larger positive percent change compared to the Big 10. While that is true, this data does not include the recent $1 billion Big 10 media rights deal, which would exponentially increase the percent change for the conference. I could not include this new deal in the data because the contract does not officially begin until July 1st, 2023.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the BIG 10 and SEC conferences dominating the College Football Playoff has caused an imbalance in the competitive aspect of NCAA football. The more money the conferences get from playoff bids, the more investments their teams can make continuing to tilt the economic competitive balance year over year.</p>


<p> Not only has the competitive balance been forever altered but the repeated teams in the CFP have drowned out the playoff hype. “Repetitive teams have tired out the excitement [of the CFP],” according to AD John Wildhack. But, the CFP might have an answer to tilt back the economic balance of college football back toward equilibrium. Expansion. </p>

<p> The excitement of the playoffs was re-energized as the CFP announced the expansion to a 12-team playoff starting in 2024. The new format of the playoff will contain each of the Power 5 conference champions (BIG 10, SEC, BIG 12, PAC 12, and ACC), plus the AAC champion, and an additional 6 at-large teams. The top 4 teams will receive byes and the first round matchups will be played at the higher seeds home field. The quarterfinals and semifinals would be one of the New Year’s Six bowls, and the championship game would remain the National Championship Game with no bowl name attached.   </p>

<p> This updated format will help even out the chance of making the CFP and ensure every major conference is represented and provide the opportunity to win a national championship. Wildhack also loves the expansion because “it adds more importance to games in December.”  </p>

<p> The increased importance of December games, along with first round matchups at the higher seeds home field should also grow total revenue for every conference in college football, not just the BIG 10 and SEC. This is because the more competitive games hosted at a college site, the more a school nets in game day revenue, adding to the annual total.  </p>

<p> Overall, while the invention of the CFP increased revenue across college football it created an imbalance between conferences. Can the expansion to a 12-team playoff close the revenue gap between the BIG 10 and SEC compared to the others in the Power 5? We will just have to wait and see.
